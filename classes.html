        Gentle yoga is ideal for your students who want to progress slowly, but want to increase flexibility, and focus on breathing. Gentle yoga comprises selected poses that flow in a structured way without straining the stretched muscles and joints.While practicing gentle yoga the body movements are in deep connection with the breath. The practice focuses on getting the body in the pose and then remaining in the posture for a stipulated period. Gentle yoga is extremely helpful in
        opening the muscles around the organs without straining or overstretching them.
